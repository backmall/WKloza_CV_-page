      <h3>Traveling</h3>
      <p>Traveling has always been my passion. I have visited majority of countries of Europe and a few outside Europe too. One of my favourite places to visit are Mediteranean countries. Hot climate, sunny days spent on the beach and ancient monuments is a perfect combination for me to relax! </p>

      <h3>Football</h3>
      <p>Since I was able to walk I was playing football. I was playing in every possible moment but due to an injury i had to stop, but my love for football continued. I started watching profesional football players on TV and when i got older I also started watching matches at the stadium. </p>

      <h3>Non-profit organizations</h3>
      <p>In order to improve my various skills I am often taking part in many events as a volunteer. One of my greatest achievements in this field was being an organizer of LDI - the biggest IT conference in Eastern Europe. My task was to prepare the website of the event and to find companies willing to be sponsors of the event. The conference itself was a great success and I really enjoyed being part of that team.  </p>
